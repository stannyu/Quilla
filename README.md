## Description

Install dependencies by using `yarn install` (you should have it installed). 

In the root folder run `yarn serve` to start json-server and `yarn start` in separate terminal window.

Open browser tab at `http://localhost:1234/` to see project

Data will be served from `db.json` file. POST requests are mocked - you will see notification popup with form data if form is valid.

Finalize button will check all the forms and check if Sellers form total percentage equal to 100. But you will see notification only for the last form (I didn't complete correct notification for this case coz this is getting too big for test task), but you will see validation on Sellers form.

POST/PUT responses and requests are not complete due to json-server limitations and size of job to be done to complete this.

*Happy reviewing!*
